		"I've had an interest on the Internet, its potencial and several of its sub-cultures for as long as I can remember.\
    This interest led me to freelance (part-time) in most areas related to creating and maintaining web projects, from CMS Development, Design, Video and Digital Marketing until\
    I finally decided to make the jump to Full-Stack Web Development through an Intensive Coding Bootcamp.\
    In 2020 I did the LeWagon Coding Bootcamp in Lisbon based on Ruby on Rails and Vanilla Javascript.\
    While coding my own projects, I quickly learned the importance of Javascript for User Experience, which led me to learn React through online courses.\
    I had plans to find a job as a Rails&React full-stack Developer or simply Front-end Developer but the amazing ecosystem with amazing new things coming up everyday \
    in the Javascript world made me decide to jump into Nodejs aswell\
    After a very complete Nodejs course, I'm now happy with my stack as a Javascript Developer with React/Nextjs and Nodejs.",

		"In my free time I play bass and guitar and I skate ocasionally (I've been skating for around 15 years), \
    Something I always try to do is to be intentional with the media I watch, so I make an effort to schedule and watch good movies and TV shows \
    and to read, watch videos or browse sub-reddits about philosophy, politics, technology and media.\
    I also really like to travel and international environments in general, I've studied abroad, did a few Interrail/hitchiking trips, and worked part-time in an Hostel",
